# Task 8: Working with VPNs

## Objective
Understand how VPNs help protect privacy and secure communication by hiding your real IP and encrypting network traffic.

## Tools Used
- ProtonVPN
- WhatIsMyIPAddress.com (for IP verification)

## Steps Followed
1. Installed **ProtonVPN** on Windows.  
2. Checked my original IP address using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
3. Connected to a ProtonVPN **Netherlands server**.  
4. Verified the IP changed to the Netherlands using the same site.  
5. Browsed the internet to confirm traffic was tunneled via VPN.  
6. Disconnected VPN and checked that the IP reverted to my ISP (India).  

## Screenshots
- `vpn_ip_before.png` → Original IP (India)  
- `vpn_connected.png` → ProtonVPN connected to Netherlands server  
- `vpn_ip_after.png` → Changed IP showing Netherlands  

## Conclusion
This task showed how ProtonVPN successfully masked my real IP address and encrypted traffic.  
VPNs help protect user privacy, bypass geo-restrictions, and secure public Wi-Fi usage.  
Using VPN regularly, especially on untrusted networks, is recommended for better security.
